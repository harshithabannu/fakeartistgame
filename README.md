Fake Artist Game
Description
The Fake Artist Game is a fun and interactive drawing game designed for groups of players. In this game, players take on the roles of artists, with one player designated as the "fake artist." The artists receive the same drawing topic, while the fake artist does not know what the topic is. Players draw their assigned topics, and at the end of the round, everyone votes to identify the fake artist.

The game encourages creativity, teamwork, and a bit of deception, making it an engaging activity for friends and family gatherings.
